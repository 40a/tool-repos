Resmon is a lightweight utility for local host monitoring that can be queried
by tools such as nagios over http. One of the main design goals is portability:
that resmon should require nothing more than a default install of Perl. Built
with the philosophy that "we are smart because we are dumb," that is, local
requirements should be minimal to ease deployment on multiple platforms.
