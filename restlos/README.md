## About

[RESTlos] \(german for _completely_, _totally_\) is a generic [Nagios] api. Generic means, it can be used with 
every core that understands the nagios configuration syntax (for example icinga, shinken, etc). It provides a RESTful 
api for generating any standard nagios object, modify it or delete it. 

There are also some convenient functions for reloading the core (via command file) or verify the actual configuration 
via the REST interface.
